<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">DARK FOREST</p>
<p>The forest swallowed you whole as you stepped beneath its twisted branches.
The sound of the wind turned into whispers — soft, human whispers.
<br/>
A flickering light appeared ahead, swaying in the darkness.
You moved closer and realized it came from a lantern held by a shadowy figure in a tattered cloak.
<br/>
Behind you, another light appeared — this time, from a pumpkin-headed scarecrow moving slowly toward you.</p>

<p>Will you approach the cloaked figure or run from the scarecrow?</p>
