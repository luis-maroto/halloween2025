<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">RUN FROM THE SCARECROW</p>
<p>You ran as fast as you could, your breath fogging in the cold air.
<br/>
The sound of straw scraping against the ground grew louder behind you.
<br/>
You stumbled into a clearing and fell—onto a pile of hay.
<br/>
When you looked up, you saw dozens of scarecrows surrounding you, all with burning eyes.
<br/>
They began to laugh.</p>
