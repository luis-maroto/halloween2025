<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">APPROACH THE CLOAKED FIGURE</p>
<p>The figure turned as you approached. Under the hood, you saw only darkness—and glowing red eyes.
<br/>
It raised a bony hand and offered you the lantern.
<br/>
When you took it, the figure vanished, leaving you alone... until you realized the whispers had stopped—because they were <em>inside</em> your head.</p>
