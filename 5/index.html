<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ONE SCARY NIGHT...</p>
<p>The clock struck midnight as the cold October wind whispered through the empty streets. You were walking home from a Halloween party, your costume still damp from the rain. Suddenly, the streetlights flickered… and went out.
<br/>
From the darkness, two paths emerged before you:
<br/>
— To your left, an old abandoned mansion, its windows glowing faintly from within.
<br/>
— To your right, a dense forest, where strange whispers echoed through the trees.
<br/>
Your heart pounded. The air felt heavy. Tonight, you would have to make a choice…</p>
