<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">HAUNTED MANSION</p>
<p>The front door creaked as you stepped inside the mansion. Cobwebs hung from the ceiling, and the smell of decay filled the air. A painting of a woman with hollow eyes stared at you from the wall.
<br/>
Suddenly, a loud bang echoed upstairs. You saw a staircase leading up to the second floor and a narrow hallway that seemed to lead to the basement.<p>
