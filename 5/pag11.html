<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">GO UPSTAIRS</p>
<p>The stairs groaned beneath your feet as you climbed.
<br/>
At the top, a door slowly opened by itself, revealing a candlelit room.
<br/>
A woman stood in front of a mirror, her back turned to you.
<br/>
You called out—no answer. When she turned around, her face was <em>yours</em>.
<br/>
The candle went out. You were never seen again.</p>
