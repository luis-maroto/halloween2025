    <h1><strong>The Corridor of Shadows</strong></h1>


    <tr>

        <td>Daniel chose to follow the corridor, which stretched into total darkness. As he moved forward, the walls began to slowly close in, as if breathing, pulsing with a life of their own and a rhythm that mimicked a grotesque heart. They whispered names of people who had disappeared in the town, including the Morales family, and their voices seemed to bounce around inside his head, confusing his thoughts.<br>

<br>Each step echoed with screams and wails, and sometimes he swore he saw ghostly hands reaching out toward him from the walls.<br>

  
The cold that enveloped him was almost tangible, as if his bones were freezing from within. He tried to move forward, but with every meter he traveled, he felt the corridor lengthen, distorting reality, as if it were taking him to another dimension.<br>

Halfway down the hallway, he saw a small door engraved with strange symbols: a circle with crosses and twisted human figures, which seemed to move when no one looked directly. The feeling of danger was unbearable. An inner voice warned him that what he would find there would change his life forever.<br>
