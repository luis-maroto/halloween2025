        <h2>Clara slid the key into the lock of Room 313. The door creaked open, releasing a breath of cold air. The lamp flickered on its own, revealing the cracked mirror and a bed draped in dust. <br>
<br> She stepped closer to the mirror, brushing away a film of grime—only to see, for a second, someone standing behind her. But when she turned, the room was empty. <br>
<br> Then came a whisper: <cite>“He’s still here.”</cite> <br>
<br> The reflection grinned, though Clara’s face did not. <br>
<br> Her heartbeat thundered as the mirror began to ripple like water. A hand reached out from the glass, pale and trembling. <br>
<br> What should she do?
