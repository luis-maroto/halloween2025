        <h2>A storm had swallowed the road when Clara spotted the faded sign of The Crescent Hotel. Desperate for shelter, she pushed open the heavy doors. <br>
<br> Inside, time seemed trapped—the wallpaper peeling, the chandelier trembling with every thunderclap. The old clerk handed her a key marked Room 313, his voice barely above a whisper. <br>
<br> <cite>“You’ll hear things tonight,” he said. “Just… don’t listen.”</cite> <br>
<br> Clara forced a smile, trying to ignore the uneasy chill crawling up her spine. <br>
<br> As she climbed the stairs, she heard a faint tapping sound—coming from somewhere above… or maybe below. <br>
<br> Now, the choice is yours:
