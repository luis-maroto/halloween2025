    <h1>Inside the House</h1>
    <p>The old wooden door creaks loudly as you push it open. Dust swirls in the weak moonlight filtering through the broken windows. Every step echoes across the empty hall, and the shadows of broken furniture stretch and twist in strange shapes. The smell of old wood and damp earth fills your nostrils.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a soft whisper reaches your ears, calling your name. It is almost like a faint plea, echoing through the walls of the house. Your heart pounds as a mix of fear and curiosity pulls you deeper inside.</p>
    <p>Do you follow the whisper or explore a safer room with a flashlight?</p>
