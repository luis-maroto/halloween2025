    <h1>Around the House</h1>
    <p>You decide not to enter through the front door. Walking around the house, the walls are overgrown with dry, twisted vines, and the cold wind chills you to the bone. You notice the basement door is slightly ajar, faint light flickering inside. The air smells of damp earth and something faintly sweet, like decayed pumpkins.</p>
    <p>A shiver runs down your spine as you imagine what might be lurking below. Do you dare to descend into the basement, or is it wiser to leave before curiosity traps you?</p>
