    <h1>The Whisper</h1>
    <p>You follow the whisper through a long corridor until you reach a room filled with antique mirrors. One mirror reflects your imageâ€”but it begins to move on its own, smiling in a way you do not. The air grows colder, and your breath becomes visible in faint clouds. A shadow emerges behind you, stretching across the floor and walls.</p>
    <p>The whisper grows louder, almost a voice now, urging you to face the unknown. You feel your heart race and your hands tremble. Do you confront the shadow bravely or flee toward the exit?</p>
