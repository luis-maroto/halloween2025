   <h1>Mysterious Halloween</h1>
    <p>It is Halloween night. The full moon casts eerie shadows across the empty streets, and dry leaves rustle under your feet. In front of you stands an abandoned house, its windows shattered and dark, like eyes silently watching your every move. The wind whispers through the trees, carrying faint laughter and the smell of autumn decay.</p>
    <p>Your heart races as you wonder what secrets the house may hide. The villagers speak of strange lights and ghostly sounds from this place for decades.</p>
    <p>Do you dare to enter?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="dentrocasapag2.html">Enter the house slowly</a></li>
        <li><a href="andarfueradecasapag3.html">Walk around the house and explore from outside</a></li>
