    <h1>Exploring Another Room</h1>
    <p>You enter another room, slightly cleaner than the rest. On an old wooden desk lies a dusty book, its cover etched with strange symbols that glow faintly. As you open it, the pages seem to float and glow in the dim light, and a small portal shimmers into existence above the desk, pulsating with a ghostly blue light.</p>
    <p>You feel a mixture of fear and excitement. Do you dare step through the portal, or is it safer to leave the house immediately?</p>
