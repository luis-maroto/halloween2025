    <h1>Brave Ending</h1>
    <p>You gather your courage and confront the unknown. Whether it is the shadow in the mirror, the portal, or the talking pumpkin, you face it with calm determination. Light fills the room, and the darkness begins to fade. You discover hidden treasures, magical artifacts, or simply the knowledge that bravery allows you to overcome fear.</p>
    <p>As you leave the house, the night seems less frightening. You have survived Halloween night with courage and curiosity, knowing that you can face mysteries that others would flee from.</p>
