    <p>You quickly hide in the bedroom closet, holding your breath as the footsteps enter the room.</p>
    
    <p>Through the slats in the closet door, you see a shadowy figure move through the room. It pauses for a moment, then continues on its way.</p>
    
    <p>After what feels like an eternity, the footsteps fade away. You stay hidden until morning, safe but terrified.</p>
    
    <h2>THE END</h2>
