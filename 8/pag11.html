    <p>You cautiously approach the glowing red eyes. As you get closer, you realize it's just a small, lost ghost cat!</p>
    
    <p>The ghostly feline purrs and rubs against your leg. It seems friendly and just wanted somewhere warm to stay during the storm.</p>
    
    <p>You've made a new supernatural friend! The ghost cat stays with you, protecting your home from other spooky visitors.</p>
