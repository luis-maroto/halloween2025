    <p>It was a dark and stormy Halloween night. The wind howled through the trees, making the branches scratch against your window like skeletal fingers. You were home alone, reading a scary book by candlelight, when suddenly...</p>
    
    <p>...the power went out! The house plunged into darkness, with only the flickering candle casting dancing shadows on the walls.</p>
    
    <p>You hear a strange noise coming from the basement. It sounds like something scratching and dragging itself across the concrete floor.</p>
    
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    
    <h2>Choose Your Fate:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="pag1.html">Investigate the noise in the basement</a></li>
        <li><a href="pag2.html">Stay upstairs and ignore the noise</a></li>
    </ul>
